Thanks for taking a look.
A lot of this work is course work in 1) Statistics and 2) Data Mining.

The Word files you see are markdown files from R. For the most part, they are just a demonstration.

The R files you see are for the data mining course. I'm taking that course now, so more stuff will be loaded.

The names of the files should explain what's in each file. Other things you'll see in the files not explicitly called out:

Bootstrapping
K-fold Validation and Leave-one-out-cross-validation

Most importantly, these are original submission of the work. While the grade I received was good, it's meant to serve as an example of my ability to pick up concepts.
